/*!
 * \brief Solves the set of n linear equations A.X = B.
 *
 * This routine takes into account the possibility that b will begin with many
 * zero elements, so it is efficient for use in matrix inversion.
 * Adapted from Numerical Recipes in C, 2nd Ed., p. 47.
 *
 * \param[in,out] b[0..n-1] input as the right-hand side vector B, and returns
 * with the solution vector X.
 * \param[in] a[0..n*n-1] row-major input matrix, not as the matrix A but rather
 * as its LU decomposition, determined by the routine ludcmp.
 * \param[in] indx[0..n-1] input the permutation vector returned by ludcmp.
 * \param[in] n size of matrix
